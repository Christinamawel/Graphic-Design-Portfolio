    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="small-line-break"></div>
    <p>After losing my job due to covid I began to study to further my career in the tech field. I started studying on my own and within a few months I had become proffeciant in Photoshop, Illustrator and Adobe XD along with coding languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and ReactJS. I then began to study at Epicodus coding school, where I deepened my knowledge of coding languages and UI design while creating over 80 different projects remotely with a team. Through my studies I found a passion for creating user friendly content that was beautiful and eye catching while also being user friendly. I love the challenge of balancing beauty with intuitive design and feel that no design should come at the expense of the message the media is trying to convey.<br/><br/>
      After graduating the course I became a teacher at Epicodus, helping over 40 students to learn to code and design applications of their own. This helped me build even greater communication skills and an understanding of how to guide. I feel now that teaching is much like designing any piece of media as both require you to guide your audience to an understanding of a message.<br/><br/>
      I now work as a Graphic Designer for FastSigns where I design various signage for hundreds of different clients. I love this work, even the seemingly tedious warning signs or street signs, As they all come with their unique messages to convey and information to organize in a cohesive way. I love dealing with the small details of a sign and seeing those details build into a picture that can be taken in as quickly as possible. I am learning and growing as a designer and hope to always continue to develop my skills while making beautiful media that will always convey the intended message to every user.
